We assume an end user has some experience with data from FRED or quandl and for his work he wants:

- a clean dataset with latest data from different sources
- browse what data is available
- read this data on a local machine:
   - as pd.DataFrame 
   - as R dataframe  
- quickly draw some charts like one below:

See [end_use.py](include/end_use.py) for examples of end user code.


## Notebooks catalog

There is a [repo for use cases](https://github.com/mini-kep/user-charts), but it is practically empty yet.


The use cases may resemble [datachart.cc](http://datachart.cc/)
or [datalab](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/data-lab)
or [viz-demo](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/viz_demo) or some other repos (eg cmf-comovements).
